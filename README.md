# **MRI Synthesis Through Variable Field Strength**

## **Overview**  
This project explores how varying magnetic field strengths (0.5T to 9T) influence MRI imaging parameters such as contrast, sharpness, noise, and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). By leveraging the **OASIS dataset**, we simulate and analyze MRI images using physics-driven models for T1- and T2*-weighted imaging. Our work aims to provide insights into optimizing imaging protocols for improved clarity, contrast, and diagnostic accuracy.

## **Key Features**  

### **1. Data Preparation**  
- Processed segmented tissue maps for White Matter, Gray Matter, and Cerebrospinal Fluid in NIfTI format.  
- Used tools like **NiBabel** to handle neuroimaging data and ensured consistent analysis by selecting a representative axial slice.  

### **2. MRI Signal Modeling**  
- Calculated **relaxation times (T1, T2*) as functions of magnetic field strength.  
- Determined **optimal echo time (TE)** and **flip angles** to maximize tissue contrast.  
- Simulated and analyzed **SNR trends** across magnetic field strengths, highlighting tissue-specific resilience.  

### **3. Noise Simulation**  
- Introduced Gaussian noise to emulate real-world MRI challenges.  
- Analyzed how noise impacts tissues at different field strengths and identified trade-offs in imaging clarity and SNR.  

### **4. Resolution Variations**  
- Simulated varying slice thicknesses (1mmâ€“10mm) and in-plane resolutions (1mm x 1mm to 2mm x 2mm).  
- Observed the effects on sharpness, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and tissue differentiation.  

### **5. Advanced Metrics Analysis**  
- Employed **Gradient Entropy (gEn)** to quantify image texture and noise.  
- Modeled sharpness to evaluate boundary delineation between tissues like CSF and White Matter.

## **Results**  

Key insights from the project include:
- **SNR Trends**: White Matter exhibits higher resilience to noise at higher magnetic field strengths.  
- **Resolution Effects**: Finer resolutions improve tissue differentiation but may increase noise sensitivity.  
- **Noise Impact**: Higher magnetic fields improve SNR but amplify noise, requiring careful imaging protocol adjustments.
